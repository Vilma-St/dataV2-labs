Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

You know both concepts but, is there a difference? Are they synonyms? Start investigating.

Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.

...


One example: Our application has a lot of mini-games. We want people to reach the games that we think are the best but the behaviour is not the expected, they don't reach them.

So we call a designer and after a lot of work he shows us a new design for our application: we will add a botton specific for that kind of games inviting the users to click on it:

Click here to discover cool games!

We think it will work but can we be sure? So instead of implementing this new botton for all users, we implement it for 10% and we compare the results with the users that didn't have it. Is there a significant difference? Is our botton working?

So, take one single example in the articles you just read, which specific test/s would you apply? (We want you just to do a draft and think a little bit how to apply the tests you already know in this case).
